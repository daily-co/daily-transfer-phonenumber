# üì¶ Daily.co Phone Number Transfer Utility

## Overview

This CLI utility helps you safely transfer purchased phone numbers and their associated `pinless_dialin` configurations from one [Daily.co](https://www.daily.co) domain to another.

### When should you use this tool?

- You are migrating from **Daily Bots** to **Pipecat Cloud**
- You want to move existing phone numbers to a new Daily domain (such as your Pipecat Cloud account)
- You want to preserve phone numbers and `pinless_dialin` configs during migration

### Notes

- This utility is **recommended** if you have existing phone numbers in Daily Bots and want to continue using them in Pipecat Cloud.
- If you do **not** need the same phone numbers, you can [purchase new ones](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/buy-phone-number) using your Daily API key.
- **Important**: Transferring phone numbers will disconnect any active calls. Please ensure that no calls are in progress before running the script.
- For more information on how to transition your applications from Daily Bots to Pipecat Cloud, see our [migration guide](https://docs.pipecat.daily.co/pipecat-in-production/daily-bots-migration).

‚ÑπÔ∏è More background and account setup guidance can be found in the [Quick Primer](#quick-primer).

## Quick Primer

This section gives you the context and essential information you'll need before using the transfer script.

### üìÖ Why is this needed?

- **Daily Bots is shutting down on July 1st, 2025.**
- If you have purchased phone numbers in Daily Bots, you will need to either:
  - Transfer them to **Pipecat Cloud**, or
  - Purchase new phone numbers in your new Pipecat Cloud domain

### üõ† What is Pipecat Cloud?

- **Pipecat Cloud** is a voice AI platform built on top of Daily‚Äôs global infrastructure.
- It allows you to deploy voice agents and includes access to Daily Video APIs and phone number services.
- When you sign up for Pipecat Cloud, you'll receive:
  - A **Pipecat Cloud API Key**
  - A **Daily API Key**, found in `Settings > Daily (WebRTC)`

### üîë API Keys Required (add to your `.env` file)

| Variable Name          | Used For                                 | Where to Find It                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `DAILY_SOURCE_API_KEY` | Your original Daily Bots (source) domain | https://bots.daily.co/dashboard/secrets               |
| `DAILY_TARGET_API_KEY` | Your Pipecat Cloud (target) domain       | Found in `Settings > Daily (WebRTC)` in Pipecat Cloud |

### üìû Managing Phone Numbers

You can use the following REST API endpoints to purchase new numbers or view your existing ones:

- üîç **See available numbers**: [List available numbers](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/list-available-numbers)
- ‚ûï **Buy a new number**: [Buy number](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/buy-phone-number)
- üìã **See what numbers you own**: [Purchased phone numbers](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/purchased-phone-numbers)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Always use the **Daily (WebRTC) API Key** with the endpoints above, even if you‚Äôre using Pipecat Cloud.

## Goals

- [x] List purchased phone numbers for a Daily domain
- [x] Allow user to select which numbers to transfer
- [x] Discover all related configs (including legacy and unnumbered SIP interconnects)
- [x] Build a full transfer plan in a dry-run/read-only phase
- [x] Sequentially transfer phone numbers and their configs
  - [x] deleting configs from source domain and recreating in the target domain

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `.env` file with `DAILY_SOURCE_API_KEY` and `DAILY_TARGET_API_KEY`

## Usage

Run:

```bash
python create-transfer-plan.py

# review transfer_plan.json, this was generated by create-transfer-plan.py
# you can edit transfer_plan.json
# for example change `room_creation_api` to point to a new url
```

Example of a transfer plan:

```json
{
	"+10114870006": {
		"source_phone_id": "uuid",
		"src_type": "domain-dialin-config",
		"config_id": "uuid",
		"config_data": {
			"phone_number": "+10114870006",
			"sip_uri": "...",
			"hmac": "...",
			"room_creation_api": "https://example.com/api/dial",
			"name_prefix": "+10114870006",
			"type": "pinless_dialin"
		}
	}
}
```

Now you are ready to transfer the phone number

```bash
python transfer.py
```

If the dialin-config fails to be created, you have two choices:

1. Rollback, i.e., the phone number will be transferred back to the original account
2. do nothing, in this case, you will need to manually re-create the dialin-config in the new account

---

## Execution Model

1. **Phase 1 ‚Äî Discovery (Read-Only):**

   - Step 1: Fetch purchased phone numbers
   - Step 2: Prompt user to select numbers
   - Step 3: Discover associated `pinless_dialin`, `pin_dialin` and related configs (including ones without phone numbers)
   - Generate a `transfer_plan.json` structure summarizing everything that will be transferred

2. **Phase 2 ‚Äî Per-Number Transfer (Write):**
   - For each phone number:
     - Step 4: Transfer the phone number via Daily API
     - Step 5: Delete the old config in the source domain
     - Step 6: Recreate the config in the target domain

Deleting the dialin-configs in the source domain is required as the
config wont be created in the target domain until it is deleted.

## API Usage

### üîç List Purchased Phone Numbers

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.daily.co/v1/purchased-phone-numbers' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <SOURCE_API_KEY>'
```

Response:

```json
{
	"total_count": 2,
	"data": [
		{
			"id": "aa197...",
			"number": "+1234567...",
			"name": "Dr. Nemo's office"
		},
		{
			"id": "bas123...",
			"number": "+1987654...",
			"name": "Dr. Smith's office"
		}
	]
}
```

### üîç List Pin and Pinless Dial-in Configs

(a) Domain-level (legacy)

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.daily.co/v1/' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <SOURCE_API_KEY>'
```

Response, look inside: `config.pinless_dialin` and `config.pin_dialin`

```json
{
	"id": "8505...",
	"config": {
		"pinless_dialin": [
			{
				"phone_number": "...",
				"sip_uri": "...",
				"hmac": "...",
				"room_creation_api": "...",
				"name_prefix": "..."
			},
			{
				"sip_uri": "...",
				"hmac": "...",
				"room_creation_api": "...",
				"name_prefix": "..."
			}
		]
	}
}
```

(b) Dialin Config API (modern)

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.daily.co/v1/domain-dialin-config' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <SOURCE_API_KEY>'
```

Response:

```json
{
	"id": "8505...",
	"type": "pinless_dialin",
	"config": {
		"phone_number": "+1234567...",
		"room_creation_api": "...",
		"name_prefix": "...",
		"hmac": "..."
	}
}
```

### üì§ Transfer Phone Number

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.daily.co/v1/transfer-phone-number/<PHONE_ID>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <SOURCE_API_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "transferDomainName": "<TARGET_DOMAIN_NAME>",
    "transferDomainApi": "<TARGET_API_KEY>"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
	"status": true,
	"newId": "cb44528c-..."
}
```

### Delete dialin-config on source domain

Note: the config on the old domain needs to be deleted before the configs can be made on the new domain. However, the configs on the old domain need to be deleted only after the phone numbers have been transferred.

The config_id is found in the transfer_plan.json, it corresponds to the `id` associated to the phone number in the `domain-dialin-config` response.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -XDELETE \
  https://api.daily.co/v1/domain-dialin-config/:config_id

```

### Recreate dialin-config on target domain

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.daily.co/v1/domain-dialin-config' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <TARGET_API_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "type": "pinless_dialin",
    "config": {
      "phone_number": "+10114870006",
      "room_creation_api": "https://example.com/api/dial",
      "name_prefix": "+10114870006",
      "hmac": "...",
      "timeout_config": {
        "message": "No agent is available"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Note: Configs without phone numbers should also be migrated using this endpoint, omitting the `phone_number` field.
